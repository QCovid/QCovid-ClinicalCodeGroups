# QCovid-ClinicalCodeGroups

These CSV files map SNOMED CT clinical codes to QCovid® input variables as used in [QCovidCalculationEngine](https://github.com/QCovid/QCovidCalculationEngine).

* [SnomedCodes.csv](SnomedCodes.csv) is the set of SNOMED CT codes that were identified in the dataset originally used to develop the QCovid® algorithm.

* [SnomedCodes_Extended.csv](SnomedCodes_Extended.csv)  this set was developed in collaboration with NHS Digital to create an expanded set of SNOMED codes, covering all the possible ways a condition might be coded, to ensure relevant conditions were not missed due to potential differences in local clinical coding practices. This expanded list is what QCovid® Calculation Engine accepts as input parameters, and is what NHS Digital used as part of the COVID-19 Population Risk Assessment (https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/risk-assessment/population).
